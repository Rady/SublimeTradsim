# SublimeTradsim

This is a Sublime Text plugin which implement the functionality of the Ruby Gem "Tradsim" <https://github.com/erinata/tradsim>. It provides translation between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.

## Installation

Download the repo and put it into the Sublime Text package folder.

## Usage

Press Ctrl+Shift+P to bring up the command input panel. Type in "Tradsim" and you will see there are 2 commands provided.

    Tradsim: Translate to Traditional Chinese
    Tradsim: Translate to Simplified Chinese

Choose the command that you want to run to perform the translation

## Limitation

I try to rewrite the RubyGem "Tradsim" in Python. However, I didn't implement the "guess" and "toggle" methods. I may do it later.
